assignment_js_sprint
====================

by Brennan Fulmer

This is primarily a test driven development project where I had to write Javascript code to solve supplied tests. The Bigger Problems folder contains a nearly pure Javascript based Roulette game, as the html file in that folder is only for user interaction. I may at some point come back to improve the GUIs, but for now the purpose of the assignment is just to learn Javascript.
