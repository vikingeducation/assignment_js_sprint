<h4>Assignment Description</h4>
<b>Basic Problems</b>  
The following functions are implemented and output displayed on index.html:  

<b>largestEl</b> takes an array and returns the largest element.  

<b>reversed</b> takes a string and reverses it.  

<b>loudSnakeCase</b> takes a full sentence and puts it into "Loud_Snake_Case" format but strips out any non-character elements (like punctuation).  

<b>fizzBuzz</b> takes an input of a number and returns an array containing all the elements from 1 to that number. Each element divisible by 3 is replaced by "FIZZ", each element divisible by 5 is replaced by "BUZZ" and each element divisible by both 3 and 5 is replaced by "FIZZBUZZ". Eg. fizzBuzz(6) => [ 1, 2, "FIZZ", 4, "BUZZ", "FIZZ" ]  

<b>compareArrays</b> takes two arrays and checks to see if they are equal (same contents in the same order). Assume they're not nested.  

<b>myMap</b> takes an array and a function. It passes every element from the array into that function, in turn, running the function. The returned array should be filled with each of the return statements from that function.  

<b>primes</b> takes a number and outputs an array containing all prime numbers that occur prior to that number, e.g. primes(8) => [2,3,5,7]  

All of the functions are contained within the object called sprintFunctions which is located in the scripts.js file.

<h4>Roulette Game</h4>
 The user should start with a bankroll and bet with each "spin" of the imaginary wheel. 
 They can choose numbers 1-36. After each spin, the result is displayed and funds are distributed accordingly (payout is 35:1).
 The user has ability to bet on "0" (35:1), "00" (35:1), "Even" (1:1), "Odd" (1:1), "1 to 18" (1:1), "19 to 36" (1:1), "1st 12" (2:1), "2nd 12" (2:1), or "3rd 12" (2:1)

The game logic is in roulette.js and can be run in browser from roulette.hmtl and results viewed in console window
