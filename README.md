====================

while(1){ go() };

Your challenge is to build a JavaScript function which solves each of the following problems. The HTML file provided (index.html) will show you your outputs.

All of your functions should be contained within the object called sprintFunctions which is located in the scripts.js file.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

largestEl takes an array and returns the largest element.

reversed takes a string and reverses it.

loudSnakeCase takes a full sentence and puts it into "Loud_Snake_Case" format but strips out any non-character elements (like punctuation).

fizzBuzz takes an input of a number and returns an array containing all the elements from 1 to that number. Each element divisible by 3 is replaced by "FIZZ", each element divisible by 5 is replaced by "BUZZ" and each element divisible by both 3 and 5 is replaced by "FIZZBUZZ". Eg. fizzBuzz(6) => [ 1, 2, "FIZZ", 4, "BUZZ", "FIZZ" ]

compareArrays takes two arrays and checks to see if they are equal (same contents in the same order). Assume they're not nested.

myMap takes an array and a function. It passes every element from the array into that function in turn, running the function. The returned array should be filled with each of the return statements from that function.

primes takes a number and outputs an array containing all prime numbers that occur prior to that number, e.g. primes(8) => [2,3,5,7]
