javascript challenges
====================

This project is a small suite of challenges (forked from Viking Education), which require implementations of vanilla JavaScript to solve problems.

Open the index.html file in the browser to see that all tests were resolved "true" (meaning they were passed).

The challenge criteria and solutions are located in the .js files.
